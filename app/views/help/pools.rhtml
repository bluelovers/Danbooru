  <h1>Help: Pools</h1>

  <div class="section">
    <p>Pools are groups of posts with a common theme. They are similar to <%= link_to "favorites", :action => "favorites" %> with three important differences: public pools allow anyone to add or remove from them, you can create multiple pools, and posts in a pool can be ordered. This makes pools ideal for subjective tags, or for posts that are part of a series (as is the case in manga).</p>
    <p>The interface for adding and removing pools resembles the interface for favorites. You can click on <strong>Add to Pool</strong> from the post's page. You'll be redirected to a page where you can select the pool.</p>
    <p>Danbooru keeps track of the last pool you added a post to. This enables a <strong>Add to Previous Pool</strong> link which allows you to skip the step of selecting a pool. This option is also accessible from the <%= link_to "post mode menu", :action => "posts", :anchor => "mode-menu" %>.</p>
    <p>Pools can be private or public. A private pool means you are the only person who can add or remove from it. In contrast, public pools can be updated by anyone, even anonymous users.</p>
    <p>To remove a post from a pool, go to the pool's page and select the Delete Mode checkbox. Then click on the posts you want to delete. This works similarly to how posts are deleted from favorites.</p>
