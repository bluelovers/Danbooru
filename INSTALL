It is recommended that you install Danbooru on a Debian-based system (Lenny or newer) since most of the required packages are available on APT. Although Danbooru has been successfully installed on Fedora, CentOS, FreeBSD, and OS X, the following instructions will assume you're installing on Debian. The Debian install script is straightforward and should be simple to adapt for other platforms. Install docs for other platforms are provided, but these are user contributed and may not be up to date. If you want something similar to Danbooru that is easier to install, try Shimmie (http://trac.shishnet.org/shimmie2). Shimmie uses PHP and MySQL and should be straightforward to install on most hosts.

For best performance, you will need at least 256MB of RAM for PostgreSQL and Rails. The memory requirement will grow as your database gets bigger; the main Danbooru database takes up around 400MB of memory by itself.

If you are installing on a Debian system, run the INSTALL.debian script as root. This will install all the necessary packages and Ruby gems. It will also create a Danbooru user account, set up the web server, set up the database, and set up the Danbooru config files. At the end you should be able to connect to the web server and create an account.

The first account you create will automatically become the administrator, so you should do this first.
