Installing Danbooru from scratch is not for the faint of heart. You should be comfortable with the Linux command line. Installing on Windows is possible but is not officially supported. If you want something similar to Danbooru that is easier to install, try Shimmie (http://trac.shishnet.org/shimmie2). Shimmie uses PHP and MySQL and should be straightforward to install on most hosts.

For best performance, you will need at least 256MB of RAM for PostgreSQL and Rails. The memory requirement will grow as your database gets bigger; the main Danbooru database takes up around 400MB of memory by itself.

Danbooru has the following general dependencies:
- ruby-1.8.6
- libgd
- PostgreSQL 8.3

Some conventions used in this document: shell commands are enclosed in {...} blocks. This makes it so you can easily copy and paste these commands into the terminal.

If you are installing on a Debian or Ubuntu system, please consult INSTALL.debian for some commands you can copy and paste.

Once you've downloaded and installed everything, get the latest copy of Danbooru using Subversion:

{
svn co svn://danbooru.donmai.us/danbooru/trunk
}

Now it's time to configure your copy. Change into the config directory and edit the following files: database.yml, local_config.rb. Example files are provided.

You should manually build the resizer extension. This obviously requires gcc and the make tools. The resizer depends on the GD library. The source code is located in lib/danbooru_image_resizer. Run "ruby extconf.rb" then run "make". You should NOT have to install the resulting extension.

Create the database. From the root Danbooru directory, run:

{
psql DATABASE_NAME < db/postgres.sql
RAILS_ENV=production rake db:migrate
}

Build the resizer extension:

{
cd lib/danbooru_image_resizer
ruby extconf.rb
make
}

Caching is only necessary if you expect to get more than 200,000 visitors a month. You will find the necesssary settings in the default_config.rb file that you can copy over into your local_config.rb. Make sure the memcached daemon is running before you start up Danbooru.

Configure your web server to connect to Danbooru. The best way is to set up Mongrel to run Danbooru, and have your web server proxy requests to Mongrel.

The first account you create will automatically become the administrator, so you should do this first.
